  <h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Discord User IDs:</strong> Used internally to deliver reminders and messages via direct message (DM).<br>
    <strong>Commands & Inputs:</strong> Temporarily processed to perform bot functionality (e.g., setting a timer or reminder).<br>
    <strong>Timestamps:</strong> Used to schedule reminders and timers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal data such as your name, email, or message contents beyond what is required for core features.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Timer and reminder data is temporarily stored in memory or via local scheduling and is <strong>not</strong> persisted to a database or shared. Once a reminder or timer is completed, its data is discarded.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> share any user data with third parties. All data remains within the scope of the Bot’s operation and is used solely to respond to your commands.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You may stop using the Bot at any time. Additionally, you can delete your messages or revoke the Bot’s access to your DMs through Discord’s privacy settings.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
